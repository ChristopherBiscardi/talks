# Title

Styles and Naming

# Description

Building on Nicole's Object Oriented CSS in 2008, BEM
in 2005-2010, and later Snook's SMACSS, CSS has a long and storied
history of naming conventions that heavily affect code organization,
design thinking, and maintenance. This talk will cover the evolution
of naming conventions in CSS, the benefits they brought, and how the
tools we use affect the way we think. The audience will come away with
an understanding of how we got to where we are and how to evaluate the
emerging crop of tools such as CSS Blocks, CSS Modules, and even
CSS-in-JS.

# Notes

This talk takes a design systems viewpoint on styles and naming
conventions using my experience building such systems at various
startups over the last few years. As such, the overarching storyline
will be related to how these tools and conventions impact our ability
to deliver great user experiences through our languages and systems.
