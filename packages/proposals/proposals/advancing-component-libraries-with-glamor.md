# Advancing Component Libraries with Glamor

Drawing on my experience building component libraries for clients,
Docker, and Dropbox, I will delve into how Glamor solves longstanding
problems with in-house component system approaches. We will cover
handling Buttons and Group overrides, Table Row hovers affecting
children, and how Glamor bests CSS Modules to enable idealized
APIs. We will also discuss how Glamor bests CSS in static analysis to
recover from failure modes inherent in component libraries.
