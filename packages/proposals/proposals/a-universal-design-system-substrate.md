# Title

A Universal Design System Substrate

# Description

Design systems are tough to build and maintain across multiple UI
surfaces and differing technologies. JavaScript gives us a gateway
into reducing platform sprawl in our design systems. In this talk
we'll cover API design that works everywhere, simplifying support to a
single technology, and how to work with systems like WordPress once
you've simplified your technical approach. The audience will walk away
with the ability to simplify their design system efforts across
typically disjointed mediums. The talk will use React for concrete
examples, but the principles apply to other approaches as well.

# Notes

This talk builds on my experience building design systems at Docker,
Dropbox, and working with clients. The goal of the talk is to paint a
picture of a unified approach to design systems enabled by recent
developments in the JavaScript ecosystem. By leaning on JS, we can
vastly reduce the effort required to maintain sophisticated and high
growth systems granting smaller teams higher leverage to achieve
better results.
