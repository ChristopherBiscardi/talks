# Advanced Static Sites

LEO is a GraphQL and webpack based static site generator that enables
usage of the entire React ecosystem and more. It allows
experimentation with Inferno, React, Preact, PureScript or any other
server-renderable framework or compile-to-js language. It supports
everything from classic static sites to the most modern PWAs. In this
talk we will explore a basic React based static site and how to use
LEOs mechanics to turn it into a Preact-based PWA that calls a
static-file JSON API.
