? How to set up a new Prisma service?

Created 3 new files:

  prisma.yml Prisma service definition
  datamodel.graphql    GraphQL SDL-based datamodel (foundation for database)
  .graphqlconfig.yml   Configuration file for GraphQL tooling (Playground, IDE, …)

Open the new folder via $ cd slim-01. You can now run $ prisma deploy to deploy your database service.
