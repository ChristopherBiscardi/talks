# Talks

This repo contains talks I've given and proposals that have been
rejected. I think both contain interesting data for others who are
trying to speak more at conferences. The content here is not intended
to be complete, but rather a useful repo for my own organization as
well as a look into proposals which are accepted/rejected and the
talks they develop into.
